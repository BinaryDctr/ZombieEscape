## About
The game is simple... RUN! There are 2 teams: The Humans and the Zombies. The Humans' objective is to run and parkour through maps to get to the 'nukeroom'. (This is a round win for the Humans.) The Zombies' goal is to infect humans before they reach the nukeroom. Each team has unique kits and abilities that suit multiple play styles.
